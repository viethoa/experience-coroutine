## Responsive principle
- A responsive system could offer periodic updates during your wait, informing you
of your position in the queue or even estimating how much longer you’ll need to waiting for.
- So you can make an decision about whether to continue waiting or take a different action.

## Resilient principle
- The principle of resiliency is about how well a system can handle failure, recover from it, and
continue to function.

## Elastic principle
- Elasticity refers to the system’s capacity to dynamically adjust its resources in response to 
fluctuations in demand or workload. This feature ensures that the system scales its resources up or 
down as required, thereby maintaining optimal performance and user experience, while also minimizing costs.
- Essentially, it allows for paying only for the resources needed at any given moment, rather than constantly paying for peak-time resources.

## Message-driven principle
- Asynchronous and non-blocking communication.
