G Junior
- In 2018 Grab system is not statable, and continuously have down time, the longest downtime is about 3hs.
- My manager came up with a solution for Grab Junior System to replace current booking system when downtime, which is a simplest and independent with current system, so passenger can book a drive.
- CEO Anthony Tan is approved the idea, and I was leading the team to build that project, at that time I am the key member of the team.
- You know, we don’t have time because the system can be down at any time, so my manager set the timeline for it is 2 weeks, it sounds like impossible, we need to build a booking system within 2 weeks.
- I cannot sleep that night, I am awake till 2 AM. I breaking down the project into 3 phases
   + First phase is focusing on important thing which is must have feature to be able to deliver in 2 weeks. You can imagine the project is rough, for example the car just jumped into map when driver moving, we don’t have time to do any animation for it.
   + Second phase, will delivery the medium feature which making the product better, for example like: allow driver to see correct passenger location, so driver can easy to pickup passenger.
   + Thirds phase, we will build up to make project better, like animation and small feature to make it work smoothly.

- I present that solution to my manager in the next day and got approval from him. Lucky us, the system is stable in a month and we got time to deliver both first phase and second phase. 
- Honestly, to be able to delivery the project, I was stay in the office with all of my team till 1 AM for the first day. We are garding together discussing how to build the booking system from end to end, and also writing code to test the possibility of the idea, these is the longest day.


DA contract
- DA is a big company working in medical examination field, they have thousand orders in a day, but they doesn’t have the delivery system. And Rida is a Delivery SaaS solution, so we are doing the contract with DA to deliver for them.
- To get DA client, I was need to work closely with DA team, address any request from them for the system. You know, every company they have different operation system, Rida also the same, so we need to adjust it to make it work for DA. We was spent 2 months to do so, just adjust and testing and adjust.
- Beside that, we also come to DA work with operation team, see the whole operation system, understand it, and design how it work with Rida, and present to the DA’s COO. Get approval from him.
- There was 3 months hardworking time and coordination time with DA to get the contract.
