##### Unit Test

## Good unit test
	- Similar as other code, it should be easy to understand, and avoid overly complex or ambiguous code base and descriptions.
	- Each test case should focus on a single functionality or behavior. Avoid testing multiple things at once.
	- Test case should produce consistent results when run multiple times under the same conditions.
	- Test cases should cover edge cases, such as boundary conditions, empty inputs, and invalid inputs. 
	- Similar for the behavior, we should check for incorrect behavior or negative test case.

## Bad unit test
	- Lack of Edge Cases: Failing to test edge cases can lead to unexpected errors and crashes.
	- Focus on Positive Testing Only, relying solely on positive testing can miss potential issues that happen under negative conditions.

## Mock & Fake
	- Mocks when, object's having the same interface as real types but can be scripted to return expect responses for testing purpose.
	- Fake when, objects that have a fully working implementation as the real type but optimized and simplified for testing purposes.
	=> The difference between testing with mocks vs fakes is that mocks are used to test behavior whereas fakes are used to test state.
	
	- Stubs: is a small piece of code that takes place of another component during testing.
  	+ The benifit of using a stub is that it returns consitent results, making the test easier to wirte.
  	+ Or may be record information about calls such as an email gateway stub that remembers the messages it 'sent', or maybe only how many messages it have sent.

	- TDD (Test-driven Development): is a software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed.
  	+ This is as opposed to software being developed first and test cases created later.
